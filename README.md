# SaaSBuilder Open Source Project README

## Introduction

The SaaSBuilder project, provided by Omnistrate, is an open-source platform designed for service providers to deliver customizable SaaS solutions to end customers. It supports direct use for quick deployment or extensive customization through forking, catering to diverse provider needs. This adaptability saves significant time and costs in developing and launching SaaS offerings. Additionally, its open-source nature encourages community engagement, leading to continuous improvement, innovation, and security enhancements, benefiting from the collective expertise of developers worldwide.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SaaSBuilder open-source project, begin by configuring your service on the Omnistrate Platform to make it ready for use. While familiarity with Next.js and Docker enhances your ability to customize the application, lack of expertise in these areas won't hinder your ability to deploy the SaaS Builder application with basic customizations. The process involves cloning the project's repository, setting up your development environment, and configuring the necessary environment variables to tailor the application to your requirements.

### Pre-requisites

- Before starting, ensure your SaaS offering is already configured on the Omnistrate platform; for guidance, refer to this instructional video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYhxQIjdbAc).
- Make sure your service is marked public for customer access
- Update your Omnistrate profile with essential service and SaasBuilder configurations, including your organization's description, support email, logo, and favicon URLs.

These details are crucial as they will be presented to customers accessing your application, enhancing brand visibility and support accessibility.

#### Optional Customizations

- For deeper and more comprehensive customizations, optional modifications involve altering the source code itself. This approach allows for significant changes beyond the basic settings, enabling you to tailor the application's functionality, user interface, and overall user experience to better align with your brand and customer needs. Through code customizations, you have the freedom to implement new features, optimize existing workflows, or integrate with other services, providing a truly unique solution for your users.
- When opting for deeper customizations by altering the source code, it's important to remember that maintaining your forked repository in sync with the master branch is your responsibility. This ensures that your customizations benefit from the latest updates, features, and security patches from the original project, helping maintain your application's integrity and performance over time.

## Deploy on Omnistrate Platform and configure your domain

Deploying on the Omnistrate Platform can follow two main paths: without code customizations and with code customizations.

### With Code Customizations

For users looking to customize the SaaSBuilder, this option involves customizing the code after forking the SaaSBuilder repository. You'll make necessary changes, build and push your Docker image to a repository, update the Docker compose file to use your new image, and then create and launch your service on Omnistrate. This method allows for significant level of customization and flexibility however it is important to remember that maintaining your forked repository and keeping it in sync with the master branch is your responsibility.

- After you have made all the customization code changes, you need to build a docker image and push it to your own repo. The dockerfile is already [available](https://github.com/omnistrate/saasbuilder/blob/master/Dockerfile), you could use the same.

```bash
docker build -t yourorg/yoursaasbuilder:1.0.0 .
```

```bash
docker push yourorg/yoursaasbuilder:1.0.0
```

- Once you have pushed the docker image, you need to refer to it in your docker compose spec

- After updating the docker compose spec, you will use it to create a service in Omnistrate. Rest of the steps are same as those defined in the "Without Code Customization" [section](#without-code-customizations).

### Without Code Customizations

For users looking to deploy the SaaSBuilder quickly and without modifications, the straightforward approach involves using a predefined Docker compose [yaml](https://github.com/omnistrate/saasbuilder/blob/master/saasbuilder-docker-compose.yaml). This method facilitates the creation and launching of your service on the Omnistrate platform, utilizing the SaaSBuilder's existing setup and allowing for basic, provided customizations. It's an efficient path for rapid deployment, capitalizing on the built-in configurations of SaaSBuilder.

For a video guide covering all the below steps, you can follow it [here](https://www.loom.com/share/58d0019c307646868dae2ba9bc56f727?sid=bab3b5f7-b6b8-4669-9dff-e53ee74dd3cc). The manual steps are listed below -

- Copy the contents of the saasbuilder-docker-compose.yaml
- Login to Omnistrate and navigate to "Build Your SaaS" and "Your Compose Spec" tab
- Paste the content of saasbuilder-docker-compose.yaml in the yaml editor and provide name, description (logo image is optional and wont be seen by your customers).
- Choose your service model i.e. Provider Hosted, to create your service.
- Follow the prompt to launch an instance of the SaaSBuilder Service.
- Specify instance details: type, Omnistrate account and password, SMTP email and password, and hosting domain.
- Post-creation, navigate to the "Connectivity" tab, copy the cluster endpoint.
- Access the SaaSBuilder App through the copied endpoint to reach the login page.
- Once you have confirmed that you can access the SaaSBuilder app. You are ready to configure your domain.

  - Contact Omnistrate support and share your domain name that you want to use for the SaaSBuilder App along with the cluster endpoint for the SaaSBuilder App. Omnistrate team will be able to use this data and do the necessary configurations in Omnistrate Platform.
  - Login to your DNS provider/domain registrar portal (where you bought your domain). Find the DNS section for your domain and add two CNAME records as follows -

    - Type - CNAME
    - Name - @
    - Target - SaaSBuilder cluster endpoint
    - TTL - Leave as default or as suggested by your DNS provider

    and

    - Type - CNAME
    - Name - www
    - Target - SaaSBuilder cluster endpoint
    - TTL - Leave as default or as suggested by your DNS provider

- Access your domain and confirm that SaaSBuilder app is now available on your domain.

## Troubleshooting/FAQ

#### What should I do if I encounter a yarn install error?

Ensure your node and yarn versions meet the project's requirements. Try clearing your yarn cache with yarn cache clean and reinstalling dependencies.


#### Why do I need to specify an environment type?

SaaSBuilder runs in an environment scope. The services and subscription plans that are made available to the users depend on the environment type that you specify when running the application. SaaSBuilder supports DEV, STAGING, QA, CANARY, PRIVATE and PROD environment types.
User sign-ups are supported in *PROD*, while other environments are meant for internal use.
